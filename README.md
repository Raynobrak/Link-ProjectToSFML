# Link-ProjectToSFML
Link-ProjectToSFML is a powershell script that automatically links SFML to a Visual Studio C++ (.vcxproj) project.

## How to use
The first few lines of the script contain an explanation on how to use it.

## Requirements
- A folder with the SFML library on your computer (32 or 64 bits, both can be linked).
- A Visual Studio C++ project containing **at least a main.cpp.** (this is important)
- PowerShell, obviously.
